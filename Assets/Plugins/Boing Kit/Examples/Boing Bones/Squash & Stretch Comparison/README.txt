Example: 
Squash & Stretch Comparison

This file contains instructions on how to set up effects demonstrated in this example.
For a general overview of Boing Kit, please refer to README.txt under Boing Kit's root folder.


Instructions:

Each rod object has been rigged with skeletal bones along its major dimension.

Add a Boing Bones component to a rod.

Set the bone chain list size to 1.

For the single bone chain, set the rod's root skeletal bone to be the root of the bone chain.

Set the Squash & Stretch curve type to Constant One, applying full squash and stretch effects throughout the bone chain.

This rod will squash (become fatter) and stretch (become thinner) as it moves.
