Example: 
Parented Object

This file contains instructions on how to set up effects demonstrated in this example.
For a general overview of Boing Kit, please refer to README.txt under Boing Kit's root folder.


Instructions:

Create 3 sets of parented diamonds (6 smaller orange diamonds parented under a large blue diamond).

For each set of diamonds, add a Boing Behavior component to each small orange diamond (satellite).

Within the same set of satellites, enable/disable their position & rotation effects the same way.

Add a script to each large blue diamond that periodically rotates it randomly (RotationStepper.cs).

Observe how each set of parented diamonds move and rotate over time.
